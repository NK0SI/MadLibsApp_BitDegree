Her twin sister, Carla, was hit and killed by a drunk driver when they were 18. Libby’s world collapsed and her faith seemed to be gone, along with Carla. Their home had been quiet and serious even before Carla died, but after, all joy was snuffed out.

She desperately grasped at the spiritual explorations that had previously comforted her. Praying harder. Praying more often. Reading scripture. Reading scriptural self-help. Talking to her parents. Talking to her pastor.

Nothing worked. Libby couldn’t find her God in her heart. For a long time after Carla’s death, Libby’s life was an endless, droning, mind-numbing void of work and prayer and eating and sleeping. It felt pointless. She thought she would never be happy again.

Her pastor told her that she might find God’s joy and comfort in a very unexpected place someday. What did that mean, exactly? She kept looking but all she felt was despair.
